# Astroid Keys

This is a helper library for the Astroid-API project, which is part of my bachelors thesis.

It leverages the capabilities of the [human-crypto-keys](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/js-human-crypto-keys) library,
which has been lastly updated in may 2019.

Therefore, it is not audited by any professional security standards, but carefully crafted to leave no room for errors.

## Install
